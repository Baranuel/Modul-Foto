        <p class="paragraph-text">In the shopping basket, we have placed the order you have made on the registration form.
<br><br>
For a whole week, you can change the order as many times as you want - and also cancel the order if you regret it. The deadline for changes appears when you are logged in.
<br><br>
What is finally in the shopping basket after you have checked out - is what we produce for you.
<br><br>
You can pay in the online store with a payment card, for example Dankort / Visa / Mastercard - or have the invoices sent to the pictures.
<br><br>
After 1 week , the pictures "disappear" from the online shop and we start producing your order.
<br><br>
You will receive the pictures approx. 10-12 days thereafter.
<br><br>
At the same time, your photos return to the online store - and it is open for re-ordering photos for an entire year.</p>
